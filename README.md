# Java Simulation Project

## Overview
This Java project simulates. It includes various classes such as `Logger`, `MainLogic`, `PhysicalMemory`, `TlbMiss`, `Tlb`, `PageTable`, `Helper`, and `Reader`, which work together to perform.

## Project Structure
- **Logger.java**: Handles logging of system actions and errors.
- **MainLogic.java**: Core logic of the simulation.
- **PhysicalMemory.java**: Simulates physical memory operations.
- **TlbMiss.java**: Handles TLB miss exceptions.
- **Tlb.java**: Represents the Translation Lookaside Buffer.
- **PageTable.java**: Manages page table entries.
- **Helper.java**: Provides helper functions used across various classes.
- **Reader.java**: Responsible for reading data inputs for the simulation.
- **Main.java**: The entry point of the simulation, orchestrates the flow of data and control.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) [Java\jdk-11.0.15]
